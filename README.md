#RockPaperScissors

### Overview
This my own variation of rock scissors paper during my scriptEd class. This project allows the user to play against the computer. The computer's choice is determined randomly through a function in javascript.

My own style of rock paper scissors consists of your standard rock paper scissors, along with a new addition of the drill, a troll, and the wrestler John Cena. 


### Rules
In my style of the game, the additions are

* drill beats everything and gives an automatic win
* John Cena puts the game on hold gives an automatic draw
* the troll gives both players an automatic loss
